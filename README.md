## Design Approach
We have chosen Java as the programming language and IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE for developing this cross-platform, scalable task management and note-taking tool for students. Java's object-oriented nature, robust libraries, and cross-platform capabilities, combined with IntelliJ IDEA's powerful tools for Java development, code refactoring, and UI building, provide a mature and productive technology stack aligned with the project's requirements.
